# [Relay - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay)
1824 electromagnetic

1831 joseph hamering electromagnetic relay. wasnt a commutatioin relay.

n 1809 Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring designed an electrolytic relay as part of his electrochemical telegraph.[1]

American scientist Joseph Henry is often claimed to have invented a relay in 1835 in order to improve his version of the electrical telegraph, developed earlier in 1831.[2][3][4][5]


Telegraph relay contacts and spring
It is claimed that English inventor Edward Davy "certainly invented the electric relay"[6] in his electric telegraph c.1835.

A simple device, which is now called a relay, was included in the original 1840 telegraph patent of Samuel Morse.[7] The mechanism described acted as a digital amplifier, repeating the telegraph signal, and thus allowing signals to be propagated as far as desired.[7]

The word relay appears in the context of electromagnetic operations from 1860.[


# [History of Computers part 1 BBC Documentary.mp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dME3wgaQpM)

prgrams for the cambridge machine used punch cards. scientists learnt ho wto make program

1 machine could do -10,000 humans with calculators
3 machines could do all the scintifici computing in britiain

they discovered that it opended new possibilities such as radio astronomy which generated masses of data.
other branches of science which needed the calculations. computing  as a tool to widen thier horizons. newspater writers wanted to believe that there was more to it. Alan turing knew thaere was more to computeres thnan number crunching.
Alan turing buuildt one of the first stored program computers. british mathematician. craced the german codes. 1936 published a mathematical problem. wrote about computing machines. and could any logical task a human coul do. saw it as a logical process which followed rules.one step by step process manipulating symbols by certain rules. code breeaking took symbols and transformed to unscramble a message with letters. when war broke out he tested his ideas. it's existence wasnt revealed until the 1970's. the encoding of germans in ww2 relied on machines. enigma encoded the day to day traffic of the forces. Turing cracked it. some from Hitler were sent using Lorentz cipher. breaking it was difficult and would require a computer. the collosus. it computed not numbers. but letters. it developed the same year eniac did. the eniac vaccume tubes carried out arithmetic. colossus broke so many top secret messages and helped to win the war. had less impact on computer development but it proved that computers could be more than number crunchers.

Turing wanted to simulate human thought. He went to Manchester university 1954 commited suicide. 

Eckhart and Mockley 
people were skeptical about the use of a computer, it needed a vaccume tube. if you could run it out without it burning for an hour you were lucky.
Finding customers, who'd want to buy.

you needed an advance  understanding of logic that the average person couldnt use it. they looked for a customer. the us bureau were drowning in records. they had a census in a few years and needed one. record keeping had been around for a century, using punch cards and workers to slave away. it was slow and tedious. they tried to convince the census bureau that one computer could replace all the workers. they were given $350,270.00 for the project. They were optimistic. They named it UNIVAC. within a few months, they realised that they had underestimated the time and effort required to pull it off and fell into debt. it want enough money to develop it. they spent a lot on magnetic tape and other ingredients. 

j Lyons company corner houses. it was a large scale food manufacturer. tea and cakes  started the computer industry in britain. They were in a mathematical background and heard about the application of computers. in 1947 computers weren available. so they decided to build thier own. They wanted to use it outside of the laboratory. by the end of 1951, the work of 400 clerks were replaced by  LEO (Lione Electronic Office).

Its programmers thought of novel tasks for them. program that would take orders. and would calculate demand and supply based on the weather???


1948 Ekert built the UNIVAC while Mortly looked for more financial backing. by this time were in business in two years and were still behind schedule. Mortley looked for more sponsors. American Totalisater company, who made the  mechanical equipment that calculated the odds at racet tracks. Strouse wanted to replace their machines. Strouse purchased a 40% of the debt. he died in a plane crash in 1949. without backing the company went into debt. The went to Remington Rand. who sold typewriters, punchcards tabulating machines and electric shavers. Rand wanted to get into Electronics. and Now belonged to Rand. It was little noticed by the company. Rand launched a public relation plan and CBS were convince to win the Lyons share of the election night audience was for univac to forecast the results in 1952.   
the first time a computer predicted the results of an election. it soon started appearing on the tube. by 1953, there were 3 univacs installed and more coming in. there was no competition even from IBm

in the 1940,s the company didnt see the need for computers. they didnt recognise it when it was coming. Tom watson jnr started to panic and tried to convince with pappy to invest in computers. but pappy saw no comercial future in these fangled machines. they were market driven, but needed to drive the market. the developed computer's for businesses. Univac were stealing customers from IBM. they launched the ... in 1953. used to run in conjunction with punch cards. his sales force were his trump card. he rewarded them with high commisions and punished them if they didnt meet their quota.

within a year IBM was able to surpass Remington. this threatened the British industry too. the British Tabulater company, later all the major british companies merged to take on IBM. 

in the 1950, the problem was software development. and could cost 2-3 times more than the computers themselves. the computers were sitting idle while programmers struggled to write programs in binary. it was tedious and error prone 1949 ASM. it was not attractive. A computer without software is like a car without a driver??? not anymore!! there was a shortage of programmers. without software the computer was useless. programming needed to be made easier. so they created Fortran. it allowed mathematician to write formulaes the way the would do normally. businesses didnt fine Fortran useful, and turned to Cobol 1959. it was very english like and was eaiser to use. with the compiler they could convert the language into binary.


most computers were found in administrative offices which replaced clerks.

computers started starting up in factories. increased automation was putting workers at risk of losing jobs. there were mixed feelings in the public. 

the bank of america employed 2500 book to calculate checking account. whose job was to process 9million checks per day. the perfect job for a computer

1961, Regan was the commercial spokesman for the Generals electric which made the banks computer. ERMA (Electronic Recording, method of Accounting). an accountant can sort 250 accounts per hour. Erma can sort 550 accounts a minute and was error free. magnetic characters on the checks could easily be read by machines and transferred to magnetic tape. it was 100 times faster then humans and error free. displacing thousands and opend other jobs that were created that werent as boring as being a book keeper. the fear of machines replacing humans was replaced.

computers gobbled up valves as quickly as manufacturers could produce them

the transistor

john bardine , walter Bataine, william shockley won the nobel prize in 1956. the same year the first transistor went into production. and replaced the vaccume tubes.  it was a 50th the size. a fraction of the electrical power, 100 times less the weight. no heat.

1962 the atlas, could calculate 1million instructions per second. connecting the components created a nightmare. it became the tyrrany of numberrs.until this was soved, computers more complex than the atlas were difficult to envisage.

the answer was the integrated circuits. Geofry Dummer first suggested it in the early 50s. but the Fairchilde semiconductor produced the first manufactured IC. made from 1 piece of silicon. chemically treating the silicon made electronic components such as transistors. to wire everything, a layer of metal was evaporated onto the structure. the tyrrany of numbers was solved. no longer was it needed to solder and wire components. 1959 it was advertised, but computer firms didnt pay it any mind. it was too expensive. but there was no takers. 

how could they put a computer ontol an aircraft if it couldnt even fit three astronauts and computers like the atlas weighed 20 tonnes. The pentagon were willning to pay any price. Electronics firms then started seeing the values of IC's. unlike the hand wired transistors. IC's could be massed produced and prices plummeted. murphy's law. the smaller the more reliable and cheaper and better. before this it was likke monks hand copying scripts as opoposed to the printing press which could produce thousands. within a decade the price of IC's had dropped to pennies.

electronic grew an dcalifornia region silicon valley was born. 300 electronics firm in a 30 sq mile area. 

8 years after John's Kennedy's challenge Nasa's onboard computer built from IC's was completed and was the smallest computer ever built. The life of the passengers depended on it 72 hours after blast off, they'd have to use the computer to maneuver onto the dark side of the moon without mission control.

by that time they were still programming with punch cards and which were difficult to program in. sometimes you had to leave it over night. and wake up to see that it didnt finish executing because of a simple mistake.

sutherland created the power of interacting with a computer with sketchpad was the first program used to draw onto a computer using software. it didnt start a big movement as they didnt see the value. a few years later Dug angelbart appealed to his colleagues to think of a different way to interact wit the computer demosntrating the use of a mouse. commercial companies didnt see the use of such a device. one of the implications of the mouse wass paperles communication.  which didnt go unnoticed.

Zerox cooperation owed its prosperity to paper copying. in a visionary act they funded zerox park for 10 years. gathering some of the best computer scientists. to make computers easier to use by the ever day person. they knew that they had too much technical knowledge to find the need to the average user.


The younger generation felt left out of the computer revolution as one computer could cost as much as  a house. Steve wosniac and steve jobs took computers to the next step, putting computers into the hands of common person. the ansewer was in how children learn piaget 1-4 learning through touch 5-6 visual aspect is more importnt and can lead them into error e.g. the amount in different shaped glass with the same volume. later we learn to handle symbolic info with difficulty. many people find difficulty with algebra. but were all good at manipulating with our hands which was the key to manipulating computers. they used the mouse and one could use it to simulate a world the user already was used to like paining apps. and text editors or music. software changed the computer to a mental tool. they created the user illusion, e.g. games to create the illusion of another world simulated by a program. they could create a virtual office with folders and documents and file cabinets. instead of the user learning unfamilliar terms they used what already existed in the physical world. xerox demonstrated the future in the early 70's but it was too expensive for the average user $45K dollars. nobody heard of it becuse it wasnt made into a successful product. they were a copier company not a computer company. they werent ready to launch into the computer industry. but it would have to be smaller and cheaper.

1970'S silicon. computers which once filled into a room fitted onto a chip which could be mass produced. it changed the economics of computing. microprocessors mass produced can become disposable as they got cheaper. it like a light bulb, when it burns out you just throw it away! no need to solder it again. IBM didnt see the mass market potential of computers and only saw industrial purpose. technical hobbists before the microprocessor couldnt do this without the microprocessor now things would change. 1975 popular electronics Altair $500 which had  to be assembled but it didnt do anything. many got their kits. 

this was dream come true for the technical hobbist. 
the home brew computer club showd ff what they got their computers to do.startups started selling parts for the altair. by 1976 there were enough members to hold a convention in atliantic city. 2 of them sold circuit boards. steve jobs and wosniac were high tech pracsters. they built blue boxes to make free phone calls. wassniac was the best hardware designer. and steve thought about the business aspect. how could the thing be marketted. they went to mike Markler who liked helping entrepreneurs. They showed him the apple. the two didnt have the background to start by themselves. 

some people used it for games and later scientific and business uses were found, many folded. apple prospered becoming the fastest growing company. each ended up with over 100M 	dollars. they finally made the computer available to everyone. 

The new market was dominated by the americans. if it can be reduced then the market could be expanded. Sinclair used to make cheap electronic gadgets, tiny televisions, to calculators. 1980 launched it's first computer, and colld be plugged into any tv. programs were sold on cassets. it took over most of the british market. 

IBM had been sitting on the sidelines watching and didnt know how to enter the market. they put out a pc in 1975, the 1500 portable computer, cost 5000 to open the box and 9000 for it to do anythng. they were selling this at computer fair but didnt do much business. 

1981 put out a personal computer and dominated the market. they were cheap and affordable but were still difficult to use. what the pc revolution needed was software even for a child to use. Steve jobs sold the ideas 1979 he visited xerox and was astonished by what he saw. thier vision now became his vision. to build a computer that all could use easily. 1984 was the release of the apple mentioning orwell, his rivals were IBM, big blue who were dominating the whole industry in his speach.

Jobs created a reference to big Brother in reference to the whole world's computer industry being run by IBM. w

they used the ideas of graphical user interface created by programs and the mouse-. prior to this computers were mainly command line interface. they were now simple to use and were userfriendly. it could now be used for several things like calculation, drawing, music, flight simulator, games, office software. the user was limited by his imagination. it then started moving away with the historical relation to calculating numerical machines. it now became multi purpose machines that can be turned to do anything.

"professor welton boxing cats". electrifying an elephant with electricity AC. Edison had the patent on cameras and made some enemies so they had to leave to los angeles the epicenter of the movie industry as he kept sueing movie makers. 

As with many innovations, the idea for the telephone came along far sooner than it was brought to reality. While [Italian innovator Antonio Meucci](https://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/150/1870.xhtml) is credited with inventing the first basic phone in 1849, and Frenchman Charles Bourseul devised a phone in 1854, Alexander Graham Bell won the first U.S. patent for the device in 1876. Bell began his research in 1874 and had financial backers who gave him the best business plan for bringing it to market.

1890 Louis Lumier Eguste, cinematograph for mass screening. the us ruled out edison holding the patent on all movie cameras. radio came out decades after movies. 

1860's Scotish james clark maxwell predicted the existence of radios

1885 Heinrich Herts discovered that a wire carrying electric current will radiate and give  off electic waves if it swung back and forth. he made an antenna. he showd how to make and detect electromagnetic waves which led to the radio measured in herts. megaherts gigaherts etc.

1890s Gugliemlo Marconi was inspired by Hertz work engineer italian, inventer. worked on how to send telegrams wirelessly. many were interested but he was the first successful. went to britan to commercialise his system. 1899 he sends the first wireless telegraph signal accoss the english channel.

1885 Tessla began to redesign tessla's motors which were inefficient, and didnt spark and were more reliable. they are still used today. Edison said he was joking. and left edison's company.

electrical revolution was about to change the whole planet. billion dollar industries emerged out of nowhere. Tessla joined the electrical revolution. searchng for investors. he was working for $50 to dig ditches. he established a relation with partnership with Westinghouse George putting him at competition with edison. AC current was enough to power the whole world as it could be transmitte alogn long  distances.

1893, there were many patent suppression and shady business deals, Edison weilded over Tesla's inventions. the war of the currents reached it's peak. 

school boys were being paid schoolboys to steal pets. and he publicly executed them with AC. publicly to prove that it was dangerous. he aided in the created with AC. Tesla showed that it was safe by allowing Current to flow through him to produce light at 1893 world fair. AC became popular and became preferred over DC. eh was loved by citizens because he made life eaasier. Edison became more dispised by other in General Electric and lost control after several mergers. Tesla designed Ac motors, generators, transformers and power transmission technologies resulting in 25 in the most valuable pattents which we still use till today. but he was just getting started. 

Things tessla invented
1893 Radio: wrongfully attributed by marconi
1898 Tesla used radio to control a boat. when marconi sent the first translanlantic message
'marconi is a good fello, let him continue, he is using 17 of my patents' said tesla.

Tesla discovered x-rays  before Wilhelm Rumchen, and was aware of the dangers of using it. it was helieved that it could cause blindness. Edison, used it on his employees who died from cancer. he also fired xrays into his own eyes. 

hydro-electricity
using waterfall to generate electricity. even from childhood he knew that it could. 

the earthquake machine. pocket sized machine. planted to a buildings natural frequency, made the building wobble. if he had 10 minutes could level . he figured out the resonance of the earth.

wardencliff tesla tower. which could transmit power.using the ionosphre. JP morgan shut down the project when he thought it wouldnt make any money? but the truth is he pulled out when marconi sent out the first radio wave. Tesla sold the project to morgan as a wireless transmission tower.

history of science, most historians egnore it becasus they dont understand it. 

James Clerk Maxwell, Mathematical theories. his precisous books, rolling hills of glen hill 2 days journey from edinborough, and Catherine his lovergirl. went to teach in 1856.

Newton wrote a book about expressing natural forces. gravity which would later b coupled with electricity, and megnetism

michael faraday, had been drawn to 1831. had been drawn to electromagneticism. an electric field could produce current. changing electric current in one circute couild induce electric current in another. similar discoveries by american joseph heinrich. this birth the theory electricity and magnetism induction. faradays experimental in electricity was holy to maxwell. he later on drew new conclusions as he was a mathematician. cambridge mathematician. as a graduate students. he wrote on "faradays lines of force". later wrote "thoughts on ray vibrations". he speculated that light is a vibration in the lines of force which combine particles mass. electric charges were linked together by lines of force in empty spasce. it introduced an interesting scientific question. "would a vibrating charge set the lines of force into vibration"

electromagnetic theory of light.
before that maxwell needed to decipher a crucial clue. he found a significant speed. any wave has a definite speed depending on what is letting it go? e.g. deep water the length of gravity and length of wave. air airpressure and density of medium. linked oscilators, spring constatn, mass and distance between osciliators. basically variables that affect the wave in ever different environment. so he needed to calculate the variables in faradays lines of force. electricity and magnetism, each with it's specific constants

k sub e is related to k sub m

c=3x10^8 m/s

maxwells moved to england londons royal institution kensington london 1860. kinetic theory electricyty. at londons royal instution met faraday, who saw electricity in mechanical terms. Maxwell saw the real image. the medium was the electromagnetic fields. he needed to find out if the force could travel at the speed of light. they'd have to obey the 4 laws of electricity and magnetism. 


Gausse Laws.
Ampere's law
Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction

magnetic wave must tag along with the electric wave wherever it goes. this can only be true if there is current flowing through according to amperes law. in empty space thre is no space. according to the mathematics in maxwells time, there could be no electromagnetic waves in space. could those laws be incomplete? Maxwell was determined to find the missing piece. he looked to the capacitor. the Farad! the only. maxwell looked at faradays book, changing magnetic flux creates electric circulatin. could changing electric flux create magnetic circulation? looking at things the other way. charge builds up in a capacitor. it can be deduced with gausses law.  

he successfully discovered the equation in which changing electric flux cna generage am electric field. the displacement current.

Enigma was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I.[2] The German firm Scherbius & Ritter, co-founded by Arthur Scherbius, patented ideas for a cipher machine in 1918 and began marketing the finished product under the brand name Enigma in 1923, initially targeted at commercial markets.[3] Early models were used commercially from the early 1920s, and adopted by military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany before and during World War II.[4](wiki)

a radio is waves sending modulated patterns. if you send electricyty through a wire it will emit electromagnetic energy, send it with high energy and it will travel far. it was called hertzian waves. but onoone knew how to use them. they were often told it was a result of induction rather than electromagneticism. Marconi wanted to use the hertzian waves commercially. 

it uses crystal used as a semiconductor.AM. Amplitude modulation. the crystal removes one side of the radio wave which without would cancel itself out as waves would cancel them out. Crystal radios didnt work well. they needed to be louder and work better. Edison rediscovered the principle that made vacume tube good for radio. Edison Effect/ now Thermionic emmision.

Lee deforest. took Flemming's diode and added a third element, calling it the triode. whichi was a control grid between anode and cathode. you can turn on and off the electrons, that's why they are called valves

# IMITATION GAME

1928
he was bullied at school, he really liked crossword puzzles.

turng wanted to work alone, saying the other men on the team would slow him down ( 6 others) 

159MMMpossible settings
every bombing attack were all floating through the air. radio signals could easily be intercepted but they were encrypted with the Lorentz cipher.

if 10 men checking 1 setting a minute for a 24 hours 7 days a week. it would take 20Million years.
they needed to decypher the settings in 20 minutes

he was reclusive, he excercised and built the machne using diagrams

they refused to fund his machine which cost £100K, his colleagues refused to work with him. The main commander (prime minister ) was william Churchill, he asked his boss to deliver a message to him. they put turing in charge. he immediately fired 2 of his colleagues cos they were mediocre mathematicians and linguists. 

he hired thers, giving them a crossword puzzle as a test for qualification. qualifyers. giving them 6 minutes to complete the task.  Joan clark was one of the qualifyers and finished it in under 6 minutes.

it is the people noone imagines anything of the things noone can imagine

he was almost accused of being a spy

1941
they turn on the computer, it didnt appear to work. the old man boss wanted to fire him. they wanted to stop the machine. the whole of his team backed him up. they asked for 6 more months, they got 1 month to make it work.

They discoveed that Chrostopher didnt have to search through every combination brute force. All they needed to do was find words that would be in the message. 
weather report.
'weather' & 'hail Hitler'

it had to be a secret.

a system to determine what intelligence to act on. which to act on an whih to let through. the minimum to win the war and the maximum before the germans would get suspicious.
they called it ultra, the largest store of military intelligence of the history of the world. 

ask it will be given you seek and you will find Mathew 7:7
he was blackmailed not to tell the authorities by his russian spy. if he did, he'd let his secret about being homo out.
He told his fiance, and she had her suspicions. he said he didnt care about her. she slapped him.
they performed thier calculus to determine which to work on and which to ignore

they won the war. they have never met before nor even heard the word enigma

his Friend Christopher was dead. he had tuberclosis.

cambridge master sentenced for indecency

breaking the enigma shortened the year by 2 years and saved 14M lives
he inspired a generation of machines called turing machines.

1957 USSR sputnick leading to the sputnik crisis. US felt inferior to the russians.
as a result US increased research and development leading to the space race. 
Darpa bilt the internet as a result.

Atanasoff & Berry Computer
Electrical engineering

found a proof in  Hobsons's variables base 2 numbers. noone else knew about binary numbers.

partial differential equations needs esttimation

first electronic digital computer

Born 1903 
Mom a mathematicial
dad an electrical engineer.
started calculus at age 9


monroe calculator was time consuming

1936 started the ABC
1937: basic layout
1939 got funding.
11,000 dollars in modern currency.
it takes 8 hours to solve - 8 equations: K=1/64.
solve 29 linear equations simultaneously
first to use RAM
uses boolean logic


Atanasoff attempted to get a patent on his machine prior to WW2 which was unable to due to the war. 
John Mauchly observed the ABC before the war and later built ENIAC with Ekhert's adopting ideas from the ABC without Atanasoff's awareness. The pair later recieved a patent and Atanasoff filed a lawsuit in response.
Atanasoff died 1995.

# [Alan Turing: Crash Course Computer Science #15 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TycxwFmdB0)

while he was a master student in cambridge
David hilbert's Entscheidungs problem (Decision problem) asked the question 
"is there an algorithm that takes, as input, a statement written in formal logic, and produces a "yes" or "no" ansswer that's always accurate?
if this were possible we could ask it questions like 
"is there a number that is bigger than all nmbers?" it could answer many mathematical questions

1935 Alonso Church proposed a mathematical question using lamda calculus and according to his calculations  there was no such algorithm

Alan turing came up with his own way to answer the question using a turing machine. Turing provided a simple yet powerful mathematicla model of computation. Although using totlly different mathematics, they were functionally equivalent to lamda calculus in terms of their computational power.

A turing machine is a theoretical computing device equipped with a infinitely memory tape with symbols with read and write. there is also state and rules that describe what the machine does. the rule could be to read the tape, write a binary. move left or right.

e.g.

num=...1111111111111111110
 
num isEven? write(1):write(0)

this is a general purpose computer.
turing machines are the best type of computers. most systems are turing complete. 

the halting problem.
"Is there an algorithm that can determine given a description of a Turing Machine and the input from its tape, Whether the machine will run forever or halt?"

is there a way to figure out if a computer will halt without executing it? Some programs could take years to run so it is something useful to know. Turing came up with a proof that the problem was unsolvable. using clever contradiction.

Program input , yes/no

Turing reasoned that "If there existed a program whose halting behavior was not decidable by the machine, It would mean the halting problem is unsolvable". Turing built another machine ontop of H (The machine in question). if A says that the program halts, the new machine will loop forever. if H says it doesnt halt, the meta machine outputs the opposite. this machine needs a splitter to only take one argument. and pases it as the program and the input to H. this shows that this cant be answered it is a paradox. This machine means the halting problem cant be solved with turing machines.

this means not all problems can be solved by computation. There are limits to the abilities of computers. no matter how much time and memory you have. This is called the church-turing thesis. 
he made the Bombe 
died in 1954 poisoning himself.

1969 Leonard Kleinrock birth of the internet
this was the same year of the moon landing. ARPA. Advanced Research Projects Agency started with 4 computers and grew to 20K by the end of 1987. it was a response to the sputnik project from Russia. computers needed to talk with each other but there was no efficient way of doing it back then. packet switching. Interface Message Processor. Nixon is 39th president. 
Stanford research Institute. log in with log. used the phone to check it confirm. it stopped at lo. 
making it the first message ever sent. it wasnt about computers communicating, it was about people communicating. this network grew. there were lots of different networks. and they had their own format. if you wernt on a network you couldnt get on. so they needed a common language to do so. 

1971 Arpanet Email. DNS

Vint Cerf and Bob Con worked years to solve the connectivity problem. they fitted a vehicle with computer hardware driving through 1977 they were able to send a message to los angeles but used three networks to do so. the handshake that introduces computers with each other. a protocol fo patwork internetworking communication. it was called internetting and just internet. 

Large cooperations, universities and military were the only ones who could own a computer. but computers became smaller and more affordable, and so did the internet for them.
standard speed was 56kb/second and people complained that it was too slow. Jim phillips developed a way to speed things up. discussion groups, email. AOL rose to the top. they used a marketting strategy to get more customers by giving out free cd's. 

1990 NSFNET officially replaced Arpanet as the internet's backbone. Arpanet had long achieved their goal and wanted someone else to maintain the internet the first web page, user friendly. prior to this they used command line 

WWW was built on a next computer Steve Jobs Next company after being fired from apple in 1985
1991 the public gain access to the internet.

1995 NSFNET released control of the internet to the ISP.

Ashby : An introduction to cybernetics
machines are not things but ways of behaving
difference can exist between two things or the same thing showing difference over time
cybernetics is the domain of all possible machines, brainwork of which all individual machines may be:
- ordered
- related
- understood


cybernetics stands to the real machine 
- electronic
- mechanical
- neural
- economics

much as geometry stands to a real object

"cybernetics deals with all forms of behavior in so far as they are regular, or determinate, or reproducible" e.g. the case of a computer has no relevance to its processing power
transition: the sun changing skin from white to tan

Theoretical machines: using a symbolic approach to machine descriptions. it is form these paper and pencil mchines, mostoly in matrix form that we discover the Law of Requisite Variety, now called <span>Ashby's Law</span>

George Boole (/buːl/; 2 November 1815 – 8 December 1864) was a largely self-taught English mathematician, philosopher and logician, most of whose short career was spent as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork in Ireland. He worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic, and is best known as the author of The Laws of Thought (1854) which contains Boolean algebra. Boolean logic is credited with laying the foundations for the information age.[4] Boole maintained that:
