1907 Alexander Grayham bells entered the long distance communication market because their patent for the phone had expired and other companies started competing causing a financial crisis. For their plan to work they needed a cheaper and more sustainable alternative to De Forest's Vaccume tube to amplify signals. 

1915 Marconi??? demonstrated first coast to coast transmission.it solved the long distance problem. 
Vaccume tubes were expensive and burnt out quickly. so there was an effort for cheaper alternative.Silicon Transistor, bells labs using germanium and silicon. solid state amplification phenomenon using germanium. John Bardine, walter Bataine, william shockley won the nobel prize in 1956 for creating the vaccume tube , was 100 times less the weight, no heat, fraction of the electrical power and 50 times smaller.

by 19?? Varous labs were expiremnting with silicon and germanium as semiconductors. However research had to halt due to the effects of WW2. The need to detect sonar lead to more research into radar. 

The Transistor was developed by Walter Bratton, John Bardine and lead William Shockley of Hells Bell's Labs, the research department of AT&T telegraph company in 1948 to replace the vaccume tube. The transistor is 100 times less the weight, no heat, fraction of the electrical power and 50 times smaller than the vaccume tube. It is considered the most important invention of the 20th century, but recieved little attention when it was first released to the press.

After the war, AT&T struggled to keep up with the demand for long distance calls as it required manual routing by operators. if the demand continued half the women in the us would become operators. Mervin Kelly realised that long distance calls could be routed automatially with an electronic switch using silicon and germanium as semiconductors. He hired Shockley to lead the team.

The team consisted of:

Walter Bratton: the eldest was an expiremintal physicist who could build and could fix anything.
John Bardine: was a great theoretical physicist with good emotional intelligence. expert of electrons in solid materials skipped three grades and entered college at 15
William Shockley: youngest and the leader of the group. his father was a mining engineer and was an expert in theoretical physicst. He seemed to understand the true potential use of the transistor and was very competitive.
the three worked along with other physicists chemists & metallurgy and engineers, and had a good rapport as reflected in Brattonâ€™s diary. this all changed when Bratton and Bardine successfully created it independently of Shockleys in 1947. however in 1956 the three won the nobel prize for creating the transistor.

## BEGINNING

1945 Shockley had an idea how the device would work and assembled a crude device based on his design but it didnt work due to the field effect. He couldnt increase the current flow throught the cylinder and asked Bratton & Bardine to come up with the answer. The two of them worked alone. Bardine understood that the surface of the semiconductor prevented electrons from penetrating and that electrons were trapped on the surface of the silicon creating a shield so the electrons couldnt reach the electrons on the inside and was called the surface barrier. Bratton built devices while Bardine suggested experiments calling shockley and other members of the team. who were. Bratton's diary reflected how pleased he was with the team, however they made little progress until 1947 during the miracle month. Instead of a metal plate they used a spot of gold separated from the germanium by a thin oxide film. Bratton accidentally washed away the thin oxide film so the gold spot was in direct contact to the semiconductor. Bardine realised they were injecting positive charges into the germanium.

## TENSION

it worked on a different principle from shockley's idea. it wasnt a fieldfield effect amplifyer. Bratton and Bardine build the device without Shockley. and when he did hear of their discovery, he was  both stunned and disappointed because he felt they would get all the credit.

1947 new years: A couple of weeks after the invention, Shockley worked on creating a more practical design for the transistor in his room as Bardine and Bratton's version was fragile and difficult to manufacture. why not mimic the vaccume tube?  

![shockley's modification](transistor2.png)

he added a third layer grid with small electrical current  which would allow larger electrical currents to flow which he wrote and had others in Bells's Labs to  witness. Shockley stopped Bratton & Bardine from working on the project and didnt  tell anyone about his modifications which caused tension and created a rift between the group. This got worse when Bell labs started writing the pattent. Shockley wanted it to be the sole inventor of it. Instead of focusing the broad idea of an amplifyer, they foces on  Bratton and Bardine's far more narrow device which was easier to defend. he wasnt there when they created. Bratton got the idea to name it from his friend who was a science fiction writer who realised that it worked by varying the resistence as current was transferred through it. Trans resistance was shortened to Transistors.

1948: The transistor was reveled to the public but got little attention. New york times page 46. even engineers didnt see the value and thought the vaccume didnt need replacing. 2 japanese engineers Masaru Ibuka & Akio merita, heard bell labs were going to licence the transistors and to make transistorised radios. they gave thier company a new name  Sony.

## TEXAS INSTRUMENTS

1954 Texas instrument instroduced the TR4 the revolutionary  radio`
sold for 41.95 three times that of a vaccume radio. could fit into a pocket. it wasnt profitable although it sold in  americans  so turned to military applications. Japanese werent allowed to make military devices so took up this opportunity to enter the market. they made improved versions of the transistors. Shockley got his wish and his name became associated witht the transistor. Transistorise became a word and became state of the art. within a few years it began to change the world. it made things portable and cheap. revolutionised the music industry due to radio. it opend up a flood gate of information and made it possible for everyone to world dramas there in the front row seat. as tea was being poured. why are they burning detroit. martin luthor king's assisination could be heard all across the world. Bardine was the first to leave in 1951. 

## AFTERMATH

1955 shockley's reputaton as a bad manager coaught up to him and left the east coast and move west as he wouldnt recieve any promotion in his job. went back to his old home in california. he was famous and wanted to be rich. he wanted to recruit people from bell labs but noone came. so he recruited others. Bob Noise, Gordon Moor who later founded Intel. Shockley Semiconductor had been running leass than a year, when he got a call from stockholm announcing that he had won a nobel prize for the transistor. 

After the celebration, Bardine and Bratton were sharing a night cap and Shockley walked in. they changed the world and had gone their separate ways, and they put all the animousity behind them.

Shockley's celebration was short lived as he found himself in financial difficulties. and history wa repating itself, his scientists revolted. Shockley wouldnt anyone to work on a device that was proving to be unreliable. he didnt want what happend in bells labs repeating. after a year of work 8 of his scientists left and founded fairchild semiconductor and became known as the traterous 8. Fairchild and texas instruments saw a way of connecting transistors without solder or wire clled the integrated circuit sold commercially in 1961 which revolutionaised the industry. 

Shockley replaced most of scientists. couldnt replace the one person responsible for the company's problem's himself. the father o silicon valley. He could have been rich. Gordon Noor and bob noyce left fairchild and founded intel who made silicon whafers. the chip. billions of transistors on a single chip. 

1972 Bardeen's work on superconductivity won him another nobel prize
Shockley professor in stanford university, race and IQ died in 1989.
