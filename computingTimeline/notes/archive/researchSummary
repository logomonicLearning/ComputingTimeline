1809: samuel Thomas von sommering developed the electrolytic relay as part of his telegraph.


1824

1831: joseph hammering electromagnetic relay modification

---

1831 : Michael Faraday influenced by Joseph Heinrich. electromagnetic induction, Lines of force
---

1854:Frenchman Charles Bourseul devised a phone in Alexander Graham Bell won the first U.S. patent for the device in 1876. 

---

1885 Heinrich Hertz discovered that wire carrying electric current will radiate and give off electric waves if it swung ack and forth, antenna.

1885 Tesla Began redisigning Edison's Motors 
1893 War of the currents climax.
1893 Tesla invented the radio, which is wrongfully attributed to Marconi in 1898

1860??Maxwell: speculated that light is a wave and that electrical charge were linked together by lines of force in empty sapce. would a vibrating charge set the lines of force into vibratin? before answering this, he had to unify 4 laws of magnetism. each has a definite constant speed depending on what was letting it go. c=3x10^8m/s

Gausse Laws
Amper's Law
Faraday's law (electromagnetic induction)

1948 - 1956: Vaccume tubes were expensive and burnt out quickly. so there was an effort for cheaper alternative. Transistor, bells labs using germanium and silicon. solid state amplification phenomenon using germanium.

John Bardine, walter Bataine,
william shockley won the nobel prize in 1956 for creating the vaccume tube , was 100 times less the weight, no heat, fraction of the electrical power and 50 times smaller.

1936: turing published a paper about machines that could think.Computers could do any logical task that a human could do. tasks requiring logical rules to follow. manipulating symbols by certain rules. e.g. code breaking. prior to this, computers were merely number crunchers. but now they were being used to decipher words. it's existence wasnt revealed until 1970s. cracking the Lorentz cipher. developed the same year as Eniac which was mostly for calculations.

1946-1953 UNIVAC by Eckhart & Mockley went to the bureau who were drowning in records and needed a modern computer for record keeping, and were using punch cards. they were given $350,270 for the project, but went overbudget and missed deadlines. 
1947 J Lyons company , a food manufacturer. replacin over 400 workers with LEO. it was purchased by Remingto Rand who sold typewriters, punchcards tabulating machine and electronic shavers. the univac was ready in 1952 and was used to predict the election. noone believed the results. They had no competition even from IBM. 

1953 IBM join the computer race. launching their computer which wasnt as good, and had to be used with punch cards. but he used his sales force to gain customers, and within a year surpassed remmington.

1957: Fortran developing a program was 3 times more expensive than the hardware due to the difficulty of writing software and lack of programmers. fortran was used to write scientific and mathematical formula. not so appealing to businessees

1959: Cobol

1962: the atlas could calculate 1 million instructions per second, but was a nightmare to connect the components due to the tyrany of the numbers. so anything more complex than it was difficult until the development of IC.

1950's Geofry Dummer proposed the IC, but Fairchild semiconductors roduced the first manufactured IC made from silicon ending tyrany of numbers. this later aided the apolo space mission which needed a small computer to go onboard their spacecraft.


silicon valley, 300 electronics firm in a 30 sq mile area.

1969: Moon landing

1800
invented the battery Voltaic pile, humphry davis used it to extract metals sodium and potassium, 

---

ohms law. influenced the telegraphs, doesnt hold in all situations helped turn the telegraph into a practical device.
