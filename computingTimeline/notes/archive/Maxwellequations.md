# [Maxwell’s Equations – explained for beginners! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJD8ywGrXks)

you can either express maxwell's equations in two forms

Differential form: useful for calculating the magnetic and electic fields at a single point in space
Integral form: calculates the fields in entire region of space. i.e. 

each form can be transformed into each other with divergence integral theorem. and Curl integral theorem.

E=electrical field
B=Magnetic field

Fe=force measured in newton
Q=charge
q=small charge
ɛ=electric force
r=distance between Q & q
electric force between the two is calculated with couloumb's law

Fe=¼πɛ0 Qq/r²

vectors have arrows on to p of them!
B: magnetic field, found that an electric particle q, moving in v, in an external magnetic field deflects the particle, the particle increases in propertoion to its charge q and velocity. doubling the chargeor speed doubles the force on the particle. the force also increases in proportion to the applied magnetic field. 

B:magnetic flux density/Magnetic field

Fm ~ qvB,
measured in kilogram meter/second squared= The unit of tesla

A⋂B intersection    objects that belong to set A and set B
A⋃B union   objects that belong to set A or set B
A⊆B subset  A is a subset of B. set A is included in set B.
A⊂B proper subset / strict subset   A is a subset of B, but A is not equal to B.

Calculus
Integration and Differentiation are opposite to each other.

Differentiation
Derivative of a function> Instantaneous rate of change

Integration
Integral of a function>Area under it's graph
