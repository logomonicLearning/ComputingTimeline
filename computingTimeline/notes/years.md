1885 Heinrich Herts discovered that a wire carrying electric current will radiate and give  off electic waves if it swung back and forth. he made an antenna. he showd how to make and detect electromagnetic waves which led to the radio measured in herts. megaherts gigaherts etc.
1885 Tessla began to redesign tessla's motors which were inefficient, and didnt spark and were more reliable. they are still used today. Edison said he was joking. and left edison's company.
1888 Le prince the inventer of motion pictures, he then disappeared from a tran iand was never seen again. Edison was the napoleon of technology,  with william dixon who invented the kinetograph. give the illusion of motion. kinetoscope by edison. the kinetophone to add sound to the pictures they were only 1 minute long. "professor welton boxing cats". electrifying an elephant with electricity AC. Edison had the patent on cameras and made some enemies so they had to leave to los angeles the epicenter of the movie industry as he kept sueing movie makers. 
1890 Louis Lumier Eguste, cinematograph for mass screening. the us ruled out edison holding the patent on all movie cameras. radio came out decades after movies. 
1890s Gugliemlo Marconi was inspired by Hertz work engineer italian, inventer. worked on how to send telegrams wirelessly. many were interested but he was the first successful. went to britan to commercialise his system. 1899 he sends the first wireless telegraph signal accoss the english channel. 
1893 Radio: wrongfully attributed by marconi
1893, there were many patent suppression and shady business deals, Edison weilded over Tesla's inventions. the war of the currents reached it's peak. 
1898 Tesla used radio to control a boat. when marconi sent the first translanlantic message

1945 Bell Labs, AT&T hired the company's top scientists. 
1948 Ekert built the UNIVAC while Mortly looked for more financial backing. by this time were in business in two years and were still behind schedule. Mortley looked for more sponsors. American Totalisater company, who made the  mechanical equipment that calculated the odds at racet tracks. Strouse wanted to replace their machines. Strouse purchased a 40% of the debt. he died in a plane crash in 1949. without backing the company went into debt. The went to Remington Rand. who sold typewriters, punchcards tabulating machines and electric shavers. Rand wanted to get into Electronics. and Now belonged to Rand. It was little noticed by the company. Rand launched a public relation plan and CBS were convince to win the Lyons share of the election night audience was for univac to forecast the results in 1952.

1961, Regan was the commercial spokesman for the Generals electric which made the banks computer. ERMA (Electronic Recording, method of Accounting). an accountant can sort 250 accounts per hour. Erma can sort 550 accounts a minute and was error free. magnetic characters on the checks could easily be read by machines and transferred to magnetic tape. it was 100 times faster then humans and error free. displacing thousands and opend other jobs that were created that werent as boring as being a book keeper. the fear of machines replacing humans was replaced.
1962 the atlas, could calculate 1million instructions per second. connecting the components created a nightmare. it became the tyrrany of numberrs.until this was soved, computers more complex than the atlas were difficult to envisage.
1969 Leonard Kleinrock birth of the internet
1969 they went to the moon. 
1970'S silicon. computers which once filled into a room fitted onto a chip which could be mass produced. it changed the economics of computing. microprocessors mass produced can become disposable as they got cheaper. it like a light bulb, when it burns out you just throw it away! no need to solder it again. IBM didnt see the mass market potential of computers and only saw industrial purpose. technical hobbists before the microprocessor couldnt do this without the microprocessor now things would change. 1975 popular electronics Altair $500 which had  to be assembled but it didnt do anything. many got their kits. 
1971 : microprocessor
1971 Arpanet Email. DNS
1981 put out a personal computer and dominated the market. they were cheap and affordable but were still difficult to use. what the pc revolution needed was software even for a child to use. Steve jobs sold the ideas 1979 he visited xerox and was astonished by what he saw. thier vision now became his vision. to build a computer that all could use easily. 1984 was the release of the apple mentioning orwell, his rivals were IBM, big blue who were dominating the whole industry in his speach.
1990 NSFNET officially replaced Arpanet as the internet's backbone. Arpanet had long achieved their goal and wanted someone else to maintain the internet the first web page, user friendly. prior to this they used command line

1840 Relay:A simple device, which is now called a relay, was included in the original 1840 telegraph patent of Samuel Morse.[7] The mechanism described acted as a digital amplifier, repeating the telegraph signal, and thus allowing signals to be propagated as far as desired.[7]
Alan turing buuildt one of the first stored program computers. british mathematician. craced the german codes. 1936 published a mathematical problem. wrote about computing machines. and could any logical task a human coul do. saw it as a logical process which followed rules.one step by step process manipulating symbols by certain rules. code breeaking took symbols and transformed to unscramble a message with letters. when war broke out he tested his ideas. it's existence wasnt revealed until the 1970's. the encoding of germans in ww2 relied on machines. enigma encoded the day to day traffic of the forces. Turing cracked it. some from Hitler were sent using Lorentz cipher. breaking it was difficult and would require a computer. the collosus. it computed not numbers. but letters. it developed the same year eniac did. the eniac vaccume tubes carried out arithmetic. colossus broke so many top secret messages and helped to win the war. had less impact on computer development but it proved that computers could be more than number crunchers.

1835 American scientist Joseph Henry is often claimed to have invented a relay in 1835 in order to improve his version of the electrical telegraph, developed earlier in 1831.[2][3][4][5]
As with many innovations, the idea for the telephone came along far sooner than it was brought to reality. While [Italian innovator Antonio Meucci](https://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/150/1870.xhtml) is credited with inventing the first basic phone in 1849, and Frenchman Charles Bourseul devised a phone in 1854, Alexander Graham Bell won the first U.S. patent for the device in 1876. Bell began his research in 1874 and had financial backers who gave him the best business plan for bringing it to market.

1820 Enigma was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I.[2] The German firm Scherbius & Ritter, co-founded by Arthur Scherbius, patented ideas for a cipher machine in 1918 and began marketing the finished product under the brand name Enigma in 1923, initially targeted at commercial markets.[3] Early models were used commercially from the early 1920s, and adopted by military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany before and during World War II.[4](wiki)
first computers appeared in 1950s-60 used in labs to share information. it enabled to share physical resources like printers and memory. many lans were developed but the best was ethernet developed in xerox park. Media access controller used to determine where a message is sent. CSMA
1854 George Boole (/buːl/; 2 November 1815 – 8 December 1864) was a largely self-taught English mathematician, philosopher and logician, most of whose short career was spent as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork in Ireland. He worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic, and is best known as the author of The Laws of Thought (1854) which contains Boolean algebra. Boolean logic is credited with laying the foundations for the information age.[4] Boole maintained that:
IBM had been sitting on the sidelines watching and didnt know how to enter the market. they put out a pc in 1975, the 1500 portable computer, cost 5000 to open the box and 9000 for it to do anythng. they were selling this at computer fair but didnt do much business. 
In 2008, “Satoshi Nakamoto,” likely a
in the 1940,s the company didnt see the need for computers. they didnt recognise it when it was coming. Tom watson jnr started to panic and tried to convince with pappy to invest in computers. but pappy saw no comercial future in these fangled machines. they were market driven, but needed to drive the market. the developed computer's for businesses. Univac were stealing customers from IBM. they launched the ... in 1953. used to run in conjunction with punch cards. his sales force were his trump card. he rewarded them with high commisions and punished them if they didnt meet their quota.
in the 1950, the problem was software development. and could cost 2-3 times more than the computers themselves. the computers were sitting idle while programmers struggled to write programs in binary. it was tedious and error prone 1949 ASM. it was not attractive. A computer without software is like a car without a driver??? not anymore!! there was a shortage of programmers. without software the computer was useless. programming needed to be made easier. so they created Fortran. it allowed mathematician to write formulaes the way the would do normally. businesses didnt fine Fortran useful, and turned to Cobol 1959. it was very english like and was eaiser to use. with the compiler they could convert the language into binary.
1835 Relay It is claimed that English inventor Edward Davy "certainly invented the electric relay"[6] in his electric telegraph c.1835.
j Lyons company corner houses. it was a large scale food manufacturer. tea and cakes  started the computer industry in britain. They were in a mathematical background and heard about the application of computers. in 1947 computers weren available. so they decided to build thier own. They wanted to use it outside of the laboratory. by the end of 1951, the work of 400 clerks were replaced by  LEO (Lione Electronic Office).
James Clerk Maxwell, Mathematical theories. his precisous books, rolling hills of glen hill 2 days journey from edinborough, and Catherine his lovergirl. went to teach in 1856.
john bardine , walter Bataine, william shockley won the nobel prize in 1956. the same year the first transistor went into production. and replaced the vaccume tubes.  it was a 50th the size. a fraction of the electrical power, 100 times less the weight. no heat.
late 1800s the television
1861 maxwells moved to england londons royal institution kensington london 1860. kinetic theory electricyty. at londons royal instution met faraday, who saw electricity in mechanical terms. Maxwell saw the real image. the medium was the electromagnetic fields. he needed to find out if the force could travel at the speed of light. they'd have to obey the 4 laws of electricity and magnetism. 
michael faraday, had been drawn to 1831. had been drawn to electromagneticism. an electric field could produce current. changing electric current in one circute couild induce electric current in another. similar discoveries by american joseph heinrich. this birth the theory electricity and magnetism induction. faradays experimental in electricity was holy to maxwell. he later on drew new conclusions as he was a mathematician. cambridge mathematician. as a graduate students. he wrote on "faradays lines of force". later wrote "thoughts on ray vibrations". he speculated that light is a vibration in the lines of force which combine particles mass. electric charges were linked together by lines of force in empty spasce. it introduced an interesting scientific question. "would a vibrating charge set the lines of force into vibration"
1809 Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring designed an electrolytic relay as part of his electrochemical telegraph.[1]

school boys were being paid schoolboys to steal pets. and he publicly executed them with AC. publicly to prove that it was dangerous. he aided in the created with AC. Tesla showed that it was safe by allowing Current to flow through him to produce light at 1893 world fair. AC became popular and became preferred over DC. eh was loved by citizens because he made life eaasier. Edison became more dispised by other in General Electric and lost control after several mergers. Tesla designed Ac motors, generators, transformers and power transmission technologies resulting in 25 in the most valuable pattents which we still use till today. but he was just getting started. 
spark transmitter, with spark coil similar to fort coil used by experimenters in 1915, transmit signals across the room reciever was a tube with nikel  and iron filing as the radio signal went through the filings would cohere and change the reistence of the circuit and ring a bell was known as a coherer. change the radio waves to audi waves. there were many forms. carborandum detecter, sulpyuric acid detector
1958 Integrated Circuit the answer was the integrated circuits. Geofry Dummer first suggested it in the early 50s. but the Fairchilde semiconductor produced the first manufactured IC. made from 1 piece of silicon. chemically treating the silicon made electronic components such as transistors. to wire everything, a layer of metal was evaporated onto the structure. the tyrrany of numbers was solved. no longer was it needed to solder and wire components. 1959 it was advertised, but computer firms didnt pay it any mind. it was too expensive. but there was no takers. 
1953 Univac the bank of america employed 2500 book to calculate checking account. whose job was to process 9million checks per day. the perfect job for a computer
the first time a computer predicted the results of an election. it soon started appearing on the tube. by 1953, there were 3 univacs installed and more coming in. there was no competition even from IBm
1976 Apple the home brew computer club showd ff what they got their computers to do.startups started selling parts for the altair. by 1976 there were enough members to hold a convention in atliantic city. 2 of them sold circuit boards. steve jobs and wosniac were high tech pracsters. they built blue boxes to make free phone calls. wassniac was the best hardware designer. and steve thought about the business aspect. how could the thing be marketted. they went to mike Markler who liked helping entrepreneurs. They showed him the apple. the two didnt have the background to start by themselves. 
1980 Sinclair The new market was dominated by the americans. if it can be reduced then the market could be expanded. Sinclair used to make cheap electronic gadgets, tiny televisions, to calculators. 1980 launched it's first computer, and colld be plugged into any tv. programs were sold on cassets. it took over most of the british market. 
the vaccume had a short life expectancy and was expensive. the transistor replaced it. 1948 bell publishesdiscover of the solid state amplifacation phenomenon using germainium. it went unnoticed by the public.
The word relay appears in the context of electromagnetic operations from 1860.[
this was the same year of the moon landing. ARPA. Advanced Research Projects Agency started with 4 computers and grew to 20K by the end of 1987. it was a response to the sputnik project from Russia. computers needed to talk with each other but there was no efficient way of doing it back then. packet switching. Interface Message Processor. Nixon is 39th president. 
Turing Turing wanted to simulate human thought. He went to Manchester university 1954 commited suicide. 
tv's were expensive and so were recievers so it didnt kick off until the 1940's.
Vint Cerf and Bob Con worked years to solve the connectivity problem. they fitted a vehicle with computer hardware driving through 1977 they were able to send a message to los angeles but used three networks to do so. the handshake that introduces computers with each other. a protocol fo patwork internetworking communication. it was called internetting and just internet. 
WWW was built on a next computer Steve Jobs Next company after being fired from apple in 1985
