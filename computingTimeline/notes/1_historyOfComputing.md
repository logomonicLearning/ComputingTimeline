abacus astrolade enabled ships to calculate their latitude at sea,
sliderule 

1. 1613 book:richard Braithwait
	- computer was a job done by a person. persisted until 1800s
2. 1694 step reckoner, Leibenitz 
	- was like the adometer in the dictaphone.

	- [The mechanical turk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk)[vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DbJUTsUwZE)
3. 1822  [Charles Babbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSkGY6LchJs) &  Ada Lovelace(first programmer) Difference engine, analytical engine used to calculate trigenometric vals
	- at each increase in knowledge as well as the contraviance of every new tool, human <span>labor becomes abridged</span>
	- Ada Lovelace English mathematician & First programmer described how the analytical engine could calculate bernouli numbers which she diagrammed and resembled the first example of a computer program. it was published and was well received by the likes of Michael Faraday
	- <q>A new, a vast , and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis (regarding the analytical engine)</q>
5. 1819 Herman Hollerith Tabulating Machine company: 
	- electromechanical tabulating machine 
	- Census problem, us population was booming especially due to emigration
	- it would take 13 years to compute all the data, and by the time it came out, it would be out of date. they turned to 
	- like the step reckoner, using punch cards. 
	- he founded the TMC merged with other companies which became IBM(International Business Machine co)
7. 1942 IBM Harvard Mark 1
	- 765K components, 
	- 505 miles of wire, 
	- used a motor, most were relays/transistors. theyre like pipes. 
	- a good relay could flip at most 50 times/second. isnt fast enough, could do 3 addition/subtractions per second
	- multiplication in 6 seconds	
	- division in 15 secs. 
	- it was limited by ware and tear and would have to be replaced frequently. 
	- bugs would get stuck in them hence we get the word bug.
8. 1943 Tom flowers Colussus Mark 1, 
	- the first programmable electromechanical digital computers to to crack german codes in WW2 
	- built in Bletchley Park. (watch imitiation game.) 
	- could not store programs in memory, just data. this means if you want to make a new program, you'd need to rearrange the cables which is time consuming
9. 1945 Von Neumann, 
	- set theory, game theory, manhattan project (Atomic bomb.)
	- both data and program are stored in the computer's memory.
	- made it easier to change things. 
	- the basis of all modern computers. 
	- control unit: responsible for decoding instructiona and controlling how data moves around the coomputer
	- ALU: Carries out the calucations and logical deciisions required by the program instruction. operators
	- has an accumilator
	- registers
		- accumiliator: temp storage made by the ALU
		- program counter
		- MAR: memory address register: stores the memory location for data or instructions that need to be fetched from memory or stored in memory.
		- MDR: memory data register: register that is used to store data or instructions fetched from memory or any data that transferred to, and stored in memory. It actually holds the data, not the address. holds data/instructions. either from the ram and holding it there. or from a calculation that will go back in memory.
		- CIR: current instruction register : stores the most recently fetched instruction while it is waiting to be decoded and executed.
		- Bus: wires that carry the data around the computer. 
8. 1956, thermionic valve 
	- replaced by vacuum tubes	
	- developed to break the Lorenz cipher. 
	- made in 11 months,
9. 1975 Bill Gates & Paul Microsoft
10. 2016 7-Eleven make first drone delivery 

//Binary

8 bit computers only had 256 possible color combinations

then 32 bit came out which would represent 4,294,967,296 different colors
the largest number is 4,294,967,295
this isnt enough as even the worlds population is above this figure.

they use the first bit to denote positive/negative numbers.

- 3.5m vids are viewd on youtube.
- all this information can be accessed, but having it avialable isnt the same as learning from it.

# [History of computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M6lANfzFsM)

pre computer era

abacus
1642 blaise pascal made the first mechanical pascaline calculator.

1660 Gottfried Leibniz 
polymath. made a calculator based on pascal.
binary

ascii is base 256!!

# 1st Generation 1800-1950(mechanical, relay, vacuume tube, stored program)

# 1820-1830 charles babbage
many computations consists of operations that were regularyly repeated and made the difference engine. fixed instruction set. 

# 1830: made the analytical engine, but didnt complete. if he did, it would have sped up the development of the computer by at least 100 years

Lovelace created an algorithm to calculate bernouli numbers
she outlined many fundamentals of programming such as data analysis, looping and  memory addressing. 


Hollerith: census tabulator  
65 punch cards at a time and then tally the results. it was so successful he established IBM

1930-1950:
turing machine

1936: conrad Zuse
first programmable computer, using boolean logic and binary, read instructions from punched tape. 

1942 Z4
released the world's first commercial computer 

1937:Howard Aiken & IBM develop the harvard mark 1, 
a inspired by babbag's  analytical engine. 
programmmable calculator composed of 1million parts
500 miles of wiring
weighed 5 tonnes
stored 72 numbers
mult 6 sections
division 15 seconds
trig/log functions took 1 minute

Grace Hopper found bugs in the computer and coined the word debugging.

1900 Flemming Vaccume tube era: 1st generation
marks the beginning of modern computing, unlike relays were less power hungry and faster and more reliable

1937-1942

Clifford Berry, John Atanasoff created the first digital computer clled the ABC

1943: Alan Turing created the collosus to crack the Lorenz Cipher, unlike the ABC it was fully programmable

1946:
electrical and numerical integrator and computer (Eniac). it took the concepts from ABC and elaborated on them on a much larger scale

first high speed electronic digital computer, was programmable but difficult to do. 

1945: elaborated on Turing's ideas, and bring clarity to computer memory and memory addressing. programs and data can be stored on memory. adn to code them in binary. 

1950: EDVAC (von Neumann)
the first stored program computer  
1000 instructions per second. 
Father of computer virology

mechnical, electromechanical (relays), digital vacuumes

---

1950 2nd Generation: transistors
1947 first silicon transistor was created at bell labs

1954: first transtor computer, 800 transistors, 100watts, smaller than the eniac
1million calculations per second.

1951 Jay forrestor RAM
1957: first hard drive by IBM weighed a tonn stored 5 megabytes.

1949 Assembly Language, rather than binary
1954: fortran
Grace hopper first compiler to turn higher languge to machine code.(also found the first computer bug.) she also helped develop COBOL.

---

1960s: 3rd gen Integrated circuits.

transistors were better than vaccume tubes but had to be soldered and were prone to faults. made it more economically feasable. 

1958: Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments invented the Integrated circuit, which packed many transistors onto a single chip. reduced the power and heat consumption, making them more economically feasable.
this sparked a hardware revolution. and development of many electronic devices like the mouse. Dram and floppy disk.

1971: floppy disk ibm.

1964 BASIC 
1971: C

1965: Moores Law.
