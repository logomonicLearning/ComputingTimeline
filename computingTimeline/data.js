At one point he was working for $50 to dig ditches but later established a relation with partnership with Westinghouse George putting him at competition with edison in 1893 as his AC current could travel long distances unlike  Edison's DC. </p>
<p>Edison hired school boys to steal pets and he would publicly executed them to scare people away from AC. but Tessla demonstrated that it was safe by allowing Current to flow through him to light a bulb. Tesla designed Ac motors, generators, transformers and power transmission technologies resulting in 25 in the most valuable pattents which we still use till today. he also invented Radio (wrongfully attributed to Marconi who used 17 of Tessla's patents), remote control, x-ray and it's dangers, hydro-electricity, earthquake machine using the earth's resonance. </p>
<p>Tesla also aimed to build the wardencliff tesla tower which could transmit electricity wirelessly using the earth's ionosphre. However Marconi had beaten Tesla in the race to discover radio, and JP morgan withdrew funding right after the first radio wave were sent out as marconi's was cheaper and proven to work </p>

        text:`<p>Before wireless telegraphy, the main form of long distance communication in the 19th century was morse code through copper cables. Marconi was interested in electricity since early childhood but had poor education, and had read Hertz wireless experiments when he was 20. He learnt about Alexander Popov's experiments in atmospheric electricity which used the broad antenna for his thunderstorm warning device. and also Edwin Barlee' coherer device which was a more efficient reciever which used iron fillings as a switch. Marconni used a tapper to reset the fillings. Marconi's father was doubtful while his mother encouraged him, and after two years he was able to make an electric bell ring from 9 meters. He later replaced the metal sheet antenna with a wire, and with his morse key, balls for spark gap, induction coil and battery. he also used Tessla's 1891 tesla coil to make powerful radio waves. he steadily increased the distance to 2.5KM using a gunshot to signal success.</p>

<p>Italians showed no interest in his discovery, so he went to Britain which had the largest navy  to develop the idea. The Post office was skeptical but gave support. Marconi used antenas suspended by kites and was able to increase the distance of transmission to 15 KM. The King of Italian heard obout it and immediately sent for him and Italian ships were equipped with them. </p>

<p>the problem was to filter out the message from all the waves from the sun which is called the daylight effect. 1900 he secretly prepared to bridge the atlantic building the biggest transmission station which took a year to complete. reported reception across the atlantic. Scientists at the time expected radio waves to travel straight into space, and were unaware about the ionosphere's ability to reflect radio waves between 1000 & 10K hertz so thought trans continental wireless transmission to be impossible. </p>

<p>in 1920 Marconi was seized upon these valves and became one of the founders of the BBC. 1932 Pope asked Marconi how it worked and he replied ‘Your holiness must have a better idea than i, you are nearer to God. I dont know the answer’</p>
<p>Marconi had 800 wireless patents even reversing some of tessla's in 1904. it was due to wireless transmission that titanic was able to signal</p>
